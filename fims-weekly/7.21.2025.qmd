<div class="header-wrap"><h2>THREE BIG THINGS THIS WEEK</h2></div>

1. We are now successfully building FIMS on **ALL** operating systems on GitHub actions and R-universe thanks to many hours from Andrea, Bai, and Matthew. Way to go üí™üëç! This week we will continue to work on problems with `{devtools}` ü§¶ to see if we should submit an issue to `{devtools}` or if we just will not be able to run `devtools::test()` multiple times in a row.
2. Initial testing and design of projections and reference points has started and will continue this week. Projections and reference points will more than likely be the topic of interest for our next Implementation Team Meeting. So, get ready to make some decisions. 
3. Length-based selectivity is coming along and will be rebased to the current dev branch this week.

## PHOTO OF THE WEEK
R-opensci has guidance on writing tests for packages submitted that Bai is looking into. But, it was pretty mind blowing to learn that there is a way to add comments to a commit message that can invoke ‚Äúextended‚Äù tests, i.e., tests that do not need to be run on every commit. It was nice to know that others have been thinking about this as FIMS has struggled to find a resource or advice on what to do, see [Discussion #870](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions/870). Feel free to add any thoughts about the system below or other insights to running large tests on the Discussion board. Thank you in advance for taking the time to contribute üòä.
