  bt1: "Sorry for the late FIMS Weekly but I have been sick ü§ï and just haven‚Äôt been able to muster enough üî•to get one together. I am doing better today but still don‚Äôt have much of a voice so there is no seaside chat this week."
  bt2: "v0.6.3 will be released this week, thanks to Andrea finding an intermittent bug when using TMBad on Windows regarding how we were implementing operators in fims_math.hpp."
  bt3: "Lots of work is co-occurring in several branches, I will be missing some in the following list but I hope this helps people get a pulse üíì on what is going on:
        a. Matthew - dev-length-selectivity-rebased trying to find üêõ in length likelihood
        b. Alex - dev-dbl-norm implementing double normal selectivity
        c. Andrea - dev-osa adding one-step-ahead residuals
        d. Nathan & Andrea - dev-projections-[nathan|andrea] projections
        e. Bai - dev-refactor-nested-parameter-list updating R side of model input
        f. Kathryn - in ghactions4r allowing /document to work"

  text: "During our GitHub training with Microsoft, Bai asked a ‚ùìabout git worktrees that kind of blew my mind. I had yet to understand the full question or the response but last week with the [new version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_103) that was released it started to make sense. VS Code now has [support for git worktrees](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_103#_git-worktree-support), where worktrees let you check out multiple branches at once within a single clone. This stops the need for having multiple clones of the same repository on a single computer. IMO this is genius. I am constantly making bogus commits or stashing things that I later forgot that I stashed so I can check out a different branch, do one thing, and then switch back to the other branch. Or worse yet, I am on a branch and want to see a file in a different branch so I go online copy and paste the raw text from the ‚Äúother‚Äù branch that I am interested in and then put it in a new file in VS Code. All of these alternates are suboptimal and have led to üß®, which is obviously not good. I am excited to check out the use of worktrees and if it goes well maybe we can get Jonathan to do a GitHub training on them. First, I had to click on the three dots to the right of ‚ÄúSOURCE CONTROL‚Äù and add ‚ÄúRepositories‚Äù to what was being shown in my ‚ÄúSOURCE CONTROL‚Äù section of VS Code. Second, I clicked the three dots to the left of REPOSITORIES/FIMS, where I currently have dev-fix-exp-TMBad checked out, which brought up a list where I selected Worktrees -> Create Worktree and let me select an additional branch. I chose dev. Now you can see dev is a worktree in the list under FIMS. This is as far as I have gotten in my üõ£Ô∏è."

::: {#announcements}
- This will be the last FIMS Weekly in Google Doc form because Elizabeth created a way to distribute this via html on our FIMS Website üéâ. Emails will still go out but they will just link to where you can find the weekly and maybe a screen shot. I am not sure. Please feel free to email me suggestions.
- The collaborative workflow repository will be removed once the material is migrated to our beautiful [FIMS website](https://noaa-fims.github.io/). Stay tuned.
