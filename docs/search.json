    "text": "Clang-formatted code to initialize the changes needed for model families. Other than the changes to the names of a few derived quantities and the ungrouped output of get_estimates() users should not see any differences between v0.6.0 and v0.5.3.\n\n\n\n\nHotfix to 0.5.2 to fix bug in reshape_output() where there are now fewer rows in the results from get_estimates() because the output from FIMS (via the json file) is now better matched to the output from TMB. Thanks to @KyleShertzer-NOAA for having a plot of selectivity in the scamp case study that was not working correctly anymore, which led to finding this üêõ.\n\n\n\n\nHotfix to v0.5.0 to fix pr-commands.yml file, which was leading to a failed GitHub action and emails being sent out to everyone without meaning.\n\n\n\n\nRelease 0.5.0 contains two major features, random effects for the power user and a fits tibble found in the results, e.g., get_fits(fit). See below or the commit messages for more details.\n\nSwitch to TMBad from CppAD\nChecks that length data has the correct dimension in R\nAdds SB to model output\nAdds README files to the C++ code\nExports logit functions to R\nFunctionality was also added to the workflows to allow for better maintenance of the software via GitHub actions\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease 0.4.0 contains two major features, allowance of catch-per-unit-effort data for fisheries and more information in the estimates tibble found in the results, e.g., get_estimates(fit). See below for more details.\n\nAllows for CPUE data and landings within a single fleet and changes the\ncomposition data to be separate from the catch. If there are catches,\ncompositions are based on F, if you have survey compositions those are scaled\nby q, and you can also have composition data without catch or CPUE and those\nmatch the population.\nFixes bug in finalize() where variables were going out of scope by using a\nshared pointer and RealVector, which allows for estimates tibble to return\nmore. Output is integrated between json and TMB using\nreshape_tmb_estimates(), reshape_json_estimates(), and\nreshape_json_derived_quantities(). ParameterVector are now set using\nresize() and purrr::walk() rather than methods::new().\nIncreases code coverage\n\nRestructures R tests using use_testthat_template()\nStarts to use Rcpp::Rcerr instead of Rcpp::Rcout\nSkips parallel and distribution rcpp test\nAdds FIMS_dmultinom() distribution to match TMB\n\nFixes bug in get_number_of_parameters().\nUses static_cast([-0-9.]+) to wrap constant variables.\nFixes cmake_minimum_required to use a range and updates googletest version.\nAdds minimal fims-demo vignette.\nRemoves unused estimated_log_M and estimated_log_init_naa from\ninst/include/interface/rcpp/rcpp_objects/rcpp_population.hpp.\nAdds gdb to the devcontainer.json file.\nFixes broken model comparison project links.\nAdds dependabot.yml file to update GitHub actions.\nCombine initialize_comp() functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFixes errors in the R code found while working on the case studies.\n\ncli::cli_abort() messages were not formatted correctly when using pluralism capability\nuncertainty in the multinomial is multiplied by value within the wrapper functions, which lead to non -999 values. Now, if a -999 is present, it is multiplied by 1 and if not then value is multiplied by uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of high level/breaking changes:\n\nFits to length data using an age-to-length-conversion matrix, data1\nincludes the necessary information needed to fit to both ages and lengths.\nAdds C++ ParameterVector to allow for the estimation of time-varying\nparameters.\nImplements R wrapper functions to facilitate\n\ncreating the input model specifications with create_default_*(),\nupdate_parameters(), and initialize_*();\nadding -999 to the missing fleet, year, age, length, etc. combinations;\nrunning the model with a user-supplied argument of n_of_loops, where the\ndefault is three, to restart the optimizer from the previous run of nlmimb;\nsummarizing the output with the FIMSFit() function and class.\n\nImplements a switch for global verbosity within FIMS through the use\nof {cli} messages and warnings.\nUpdates the logging system complete with a vignette about how to use it, the\nlogging system can be used for both R and C++ errors, warnings, and\ninformation.\nCreates the initial infrastructure to implement random effects with density\nfunctions.\nImplements a helper function to get the parameter names from the\nC++ code and populate the results with those names.\nMakes lpdf_vec return 0 if data is missing.\n\nMore detail:\nSee the commit message for this release or the full changelog: https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/compare/v0.2.0‚Ä¶v0.3.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of high level/breaking changes:\n\nAdded a pkgdown site for FIMS\nAdd code cov tests and site link\nRemove recruitment bias correction and adjustment because we plan to use TMB (https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/issues/185)\nImprove logging coverage and separate logs into multiple files\nPut recruitment deviations on the log scale when input\nReport more values with standard errors\nCode cleanup, documentation, and consistency improvements\nRemove rapidjson dependence\nAdd start_year and end_year as slots to FIMSFrame\nMake log_obs_error a vector\nLoad the Rcpp module upon package install so components don‚Äôt need to be prefaced by fims$\nRefactor vectors to use fims::Vector class\nAdd Newton steps to FIMS integration test to improve convergence in integration
